## Install

1. `git clone git@github.com:cezaraugusto/chatapp.git`
2. cd chatapp
3. yarn install
4. yarn start

## Requirements

1. When a user opens the web app, they should enter their name and then join.
2. When a user joins, they are going to be visible to other users.
3. When a user is close enough to other users, they can write messages that will be visible to them based on their distance, so the closer, the more relevant the messages will be.
